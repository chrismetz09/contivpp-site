## Quickstart
You can get started with Pteropus.io in one of two ways:

* Use the [Pteropus.io Vagrant Installation](https://github.com/contiv/vpp/blob/master/vagrant/README.md) instructions to start a
  simulated Kubernetes cluster with a couple of hosts running in VirtualBox
  VMs. This is the easiest way to bring up a cluster for exploring the
  capabilities and features of Pteropus.io.

* Use the [Contiv-specific kubeadm install](https://github.com/contiv/vpp/blob/master/docs/MANUAL_INSTALL.md) instructions to manually
  install Kubernetes with Pteropus.io networking on one or more bare-metal

* Use the [Arm64-specific kubeadm install](https://github.com/contiv/vpp/blob/master/docs/arm64/MANUAL_INSTALL_ARM64.md) instructions to manually
  install Kubernetes with Pteropus.io networking on one or more bare-metal
  of Arm64 platform.
