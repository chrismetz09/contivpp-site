# Get Started

You can get started with Contivpp.io using one of serveral methods:

* Use the [Contiv-VPP Vagrant Installation](https://github.com/contiv/vpp/blob/master/vagrant/README.md) instructions to start a
  simulated Kubernetes cluster with a couple of hosts running in VirtualBox
  VMs. This is the easiest way to bring up a cluster for exploring the
  capabilities and features of Contiv-VPP.

* Use the [Contiv-specific kubeadm install](https://github.com/contiv/vpp/blob/master/docs/setup/MANUAL_INSTALL.md)
  instructions to manually install Kubernetes with Contiv-VPP networking on one
  or more bare-metal servers.

* Use the [Arm64-specific kubeadm install](https://github.com/contiv/vpp/blob/master/docs/arm64/MANUAL_INSTALL_ARM64.md)
  instructions to manually install Kubernetes with Contiv-VPP networking on one or more
  bare-metal servers of Arm64 platform.

* Use the [Calico-VPP Vagrant](https://github.com/contiv/vpp/blob/master/vagrant/calico-vpp/README.md) to explore deployment of VPP
  in Calico clusters, where some of the nodes can be running plain Calico (without VPP)
  and some of the nodes can be running Calico with VPP.

* Try [Contiv-VPP UI](https://github.com/contiv/vpp/blob/master/ui/README.md) web browser user interface on top of Contiv-VPP,
  it runs in Vagrant deployments as well as on bare-metal.
